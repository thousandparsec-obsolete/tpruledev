Todo:
Allow Components to add and remove Property associations
Allow for creation of new projects
Check validity of objects on loading and highlight those that are incomplete
----------------------------------------
Make it possible to add and delete objects through context menus in the object tree
When saving a project and quitting save the last viewed object
Make a panel to default to on start that describes the RDE
Make panels for both the Properties and Components
Look into providing a way for objects to keep track of who they're associated with, or perhaps just some way to calculate that
Save config options on app close
Get the object manipulation methods to accept lists as well as atoms

ObjectDatabase and GameObjectTree design:
Tree keeps hash of object names and treenodeid's
Need to have some mapping between the state of the objects inside of the object database and the state of the tree - ordering, highlighting, all such things as that...

On wx and Strings:
wxPython seems to use unicode strings. Hrm. That is a bit of a pain since it messes up sorting. I'll need to make it consistent, I think. Either I need to start using Unicode strings or I need to alwas convert when pulling data from a wx widget.

On Highlighting and Emphasis:
Save lists of emphasis and highlighting groups? Pass out an ID when a highlight/emphasis is requested and then use that to roll back the changes? Hm.
