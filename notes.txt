Todo:
Need to ensure that all the properties that a component affects and the component itself all share a category?
Check validity of objects on loading and highlight those that are incomplete
----------------------------------------
Make it possible to add and delete objects through context menus in the object tree
Robust Syntax Highlighting
When saving a project and quitting save the last viewed object
Make descriptive panels for both the Properties and Components
Look into providing a way for objects to keep track of who they're associated with, or perhaps just some way to calculate that
Recent projects menu item...
Save config options on app close
Get the object manipulation methods to accept lists as well as atoms
Alert the user when they are going to quit with unsaved changes

Complete:
Allow Components to add and remove Property associations
Make a panel to default to on start that describes the RDE
Allow for saving!
Fix new object problems (modified tag doesn't stick, meh!)
Handle deletions of existing objects better...if we delete a Property we're going to mess things up royally, since Components will reference it unless we make efforts to erase those references, same thing with renaming

----------------------------------------------------

On panel loading:
A single editing panel should exist for every object type and it should be filled with the appropriate data as necessary since StyledTextControls are so expensive to create.

On loading objects:
Need to have consistent representation of numerical values, are they strings or numbers? Meh.

On wx and Strings:
wxPython seems to use unicode strings. Hrm. That is a bit of a pain since it messes up sorting. I'll need to make it consistent, I think. Either I need to start using Unicode strings or I need to alwas convert when pulling data from a wx widget.

On Highlighting and Emphasis:
Save lists of emphasis and highlighting groups? Pass out an ID when a highlight/emphasis is requested and then use that to roll back the changes? Hm. It's probably best to have image icons to give objects as well. An exclamation point for an error? Or for an unsaved object? Some visual clue. There will be a number of things, then - highlighting, text color, bolding and icon that can be used to convey info.
