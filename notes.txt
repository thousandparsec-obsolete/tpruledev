Todo:
Create interface for model and view for objects

ObjectDatabase and GameObjectTree design:
Tree keeps hash of object names and treenodeid's
Need to have some mapping between the state of the objects inside of the object database and the state of the tree - ordering, highlighting, all such things as that...
